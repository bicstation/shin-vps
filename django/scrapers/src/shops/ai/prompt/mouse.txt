Analyze the PC specification from the provided text and image.

### DATA PRIORITIZATION (STRICT):
1. IMAGE IS THE TRUTH: Use the image as the primary source for the product name, price, and specs.
2. PRICE ANCHOR: The correct product is the one located near the "Red Purchase Button" or "Web Price" in the image.
3. IGNORE NOISE: The text hint may contain multiple models (e.g., in a comparison table). IGNORE any specifications that do NOT match the price and product name shown in the image.

### EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract information ONLY for the main product featured in the image.
2. DO NOT invent or hallucinate.
3. If NPU-related features like "Ryzen AI" or "Intel AI Boost" are mentioned in the specs, set npu_exists to true.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output MUST be a valid JSON object only:
