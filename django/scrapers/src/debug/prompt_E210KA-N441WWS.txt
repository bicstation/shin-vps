Analyze the ASUS product specification from the provided text.

### DATA PRIORITIZATION & ACCURACY (STRICT):
1. SPECIFICATION LIST IS THE TRUTH: Prioritize the list containing "インチ (Inch)", "CPU", "メモリ (Memory)", and "ストレージ (Storage)".
2. MODEL IDENTIFICATION: Extract the full model name including the sub-model code (e.g., "ASUS ProArt PZ13 HT5306QA").
3. NO HALLUCINATION: If a field is not found in the text, set it to null.

### NPU & COPILOT+ PC DETECTION RULES:
- Set "npu_exists" to true ONLY IF:
  - The text explicitly mentions "Copilot+ PC".
  - The CPU is "Snapdragon X Elite" or "Snapdragon X Plus".
  - The CPU is "AMD Ryzen™ AI" (specifically with the 'AI' branding).
  - The CPU is "Intel® Core™ Ultra" (Series 2 / Lunar Lake or newer).
- If NPU TOPS (e.g., 45TOPS) is mentioned, definitely set to true.
